I study the architecture and dynamics of gene regulatory networks by integrating bulk, single-cell, and multi-omic data across biological systems, reconstructing how regulatory programs govern cellular fate, plasticity, and compensatory responses.

---

## What I work on
- Gene regulatory network inference and benchmarking
- Single-cell, multi-omic, and  bulk RNA-seq analysis across biological systems
- Network modeling of differentiation, stress response, and perturbation
- Scalable and reproducible computational workflows for regulatory genomics

---

## What I bring
- Model-guided hypothesis generation and validation strategy support
- Experience translating network outputs into biologically actionable insights
- Comparative regulatory network analysis across differentiation, stress, and perturbation 

---

## Technical scope
- **Data:** bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, multi-omic, time-course, and perturbation datasets  
- **Methods:** network inference, trajectory inference, probabilistic graphical models  
- **Tooling:** Python, R, Snakemake, Docker
