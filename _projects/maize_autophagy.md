excerpt: "Multi-omic network analysis reveals compensatory autophagy programs in maize."
---

This study maps the regulatory architecture of maize autophagy by integrating RNA-seq, proteomic, metabolomic, and ionomic data across nutrient and genetic perturbations. Gene module and network inference analysis reveal compensatory pathways that reveal how plants coordinate metabolic adaptation under nutrient stress.
