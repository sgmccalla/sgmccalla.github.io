**Cell–Cell Network Inference** introduces a probabilistic graph structure learning framework for modeling cell–cell relationships in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Instead of kNN graphs that limit inference to nearest neighbors, this approach leverages broader transcriptomic structure to improve trajectory recovery.
