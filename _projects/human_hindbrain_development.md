    <p>
      <strong>Human Hindbrain Development</strong> uses a single-cell RNA-seq time course to reconstruct lineage structure across early hindbrain differentiation. Stage-specific gene regulatory network inference reveals regulatory programs that shift along the lineage and highlights transcription factors involved in fate specification.
